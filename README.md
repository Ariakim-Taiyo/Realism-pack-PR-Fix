# Realism-pack
*Notice: the Tampermoney version may not work properly. If this is the case, please try the bookmarklet version if you are able to.*

**Slowly working on updates, but if you'd like to take over the project, do let me know. Updates will include the addon aircraft being combined with this, bug fixes, and toggleable features at some point.**</br>

This massive addon adds over 30 new features, realism fixes, and a few bug fixes. The goal of this project is to modify GeoFS to make it as realistic as possible and expand its capabilities.</br>
You can review the full list of additional features and changes below.


**HOW TO INSTALL:**</br>
*If you want to run the bookmarklet version:*
- Watch this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNDEesTbKc4.
- Follow that tutorial, but set the contents of bookmarklet.js as the URL.

*If you want to run the Tampermonkey version:*
- Make sure you have Tampermonkey installed
- Add tampermonkey-code.js as a new userscript

You'll never have to worry about updating your copy of the addon.

**HOW TO USE:**</br>
If you run the bookmarklet version, please wait until the terrain has loaded before clicking on the bookmarklet. Otherwise you might have terrain collision bugs.</br>

*How to use the carrier catapults:*
Go to the flight deck of the USS John C. Stennis and taxi to the front end of the deck, then use "q" to lock/unlock the launch bar. Once the launch bar is locked, use "~" to launch the catapult. It is recommended to apply full power before launching. </br>
NOTE: You must be in a carrier-capable aircraft for the catapults to work (i.e. it needs a tailhook). </br>
*TUTORIAL:* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWT7eGtNRl8 </br>

*How to use the clickable cockpits*</br>
For throttles, click on the throttle and hold until the throttle is at the desired position. At the max and idle settings, a detent keeps the lever in position for half a second so that setting max or idle thrust is slightly easier.
For anything else, click and hold for half a second. Try not to click and hold for more than half a second, because that would trigger the switch twice.<br>
*What clickable parts this addon includes:*<br>
- Piper Cub: mixture (toggles engine)
- Cessna 172: throttle, mixture (toggles engine)
- Embraer Phenom 100: throttle, landing gear, parking brake
- DHC-6 Twin Otter: flaps
- Douglas DC-3: flaps, throttle, mixture levers and magneto switches (both must be turned on in order for the engines to auto-start)
- Alisport Silent 2: speedbrake, flaps
- DHC-2 Beaver: flaps, throttle, mixture (toggles engine), water rudders
- Airbus A380: speedbrake

Addon aircraft are available <a href="https://github.com/NVB9ALT/Addon-Aircraft-and-Parts">here.</a> They do not have animated control surfaces and some may be lacking animated speedbrakes/flaps as well, but the physics models are as realistic as I can make them. I may work on making the addon aircraft easier to run later.</br>

Some of these features were originally standalone addons by AriakimTaiyo; these have been marked with an asterisk (*).

What the Realism Pack adds:

- A brake parachute for the F-16
- Turbofan engines now take longer to spool up to full power between 10% and 70% RPM
- Advanced 2d Clouds Generation V1
